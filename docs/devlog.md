# Dev log

Short, dated notes per milestone: what shipped, what was hard, what I'd change.

## 2026-06-26 — M0: foundation
Scaffolded the repo: README with architecture diagram, docs/ + ADR-0001 (stack & scope),
CI skeleton (lint + test), Makefile, CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, and the full issue/milestone
backlog. Next: M1 — auth and the tenant-isolation guarantee, starting with ADR-0002.

## 2026-06-26 — M1 #7: per-tenant OIDC auth
Turned `backend/` into a Django project and made the API an OAuth2 resource server: it validates
Bearer JWTs against each tenant's Keycloak realm (JWKS), routing by the verified `iss`. Decisions:
a custom `User` keyed on `(oidc_issuer, oidc_sub)` — a `sub` is only unique within an issuer;
strict RS256 with required `exp/iss/aud/sub` + 60s leeway; and a post-verify
`iss == tenant.oidc_issuer` check so a token from one realm can't be replayed as another tenant.
Hardest part: keeping auth tests hermetic (no live Keycloak in CI) while still exercising the real
routing — solved by making the verifier's key-resolver injectable and signing test tokens with a
local key. The DB-level RLS backstop lands next in #8.
